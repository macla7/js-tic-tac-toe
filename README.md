# js-tic-tac-toe

An OP <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript'>project</a>

Very tired and worked a full day, then have coded this one up in ~5 hours afterwards. Ball rolling but kinda have foresaken a bit of cleanliness and good code towards the end as I was striving to just get this done tonight...

Used a module for the game where most of the functions are, some private and some public.

Then also used a 'view' module for some miscellaneous functions I couldn't really consider being in the game module.

Made two factories for players and comps. Although in hindsight, I probably didn't really use these entirely properly. Perhaps the move functionality should be with the player/comp classes(?)

ANYWAY, please also mind all the eventlisteners out in the open. I don't really know where to put them that makes sense.. in their own object? I tried looking online a bit, to no avail.. Hopefully this is cleared up later in TOP or I'll need to find a way to organise better.
